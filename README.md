SQL Project in which I analyze layoffs data from around the world. The project is divided into two parts- Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

We have our data provided as a .csv file which we import into MySQL. The columns present are-
1. company
2. location
3. industry
4. total_laid_off
5. percentage_laid_off
6. date
7. stage
8. country
9. funds_raised_millions

For Data Cleaning, we do the following steps-
1. Remove duplicates
2. Standardize the data
3. Null Values or blank values
4. Remove any columns or rows

For EDA, we have not followed any specific steps but explored our data to find some interesting insights about the layoffs data. We figure out yearwise and companywise lay offs. We also find rolling total monthwise lay offs.
